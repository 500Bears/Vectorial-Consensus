## Introduction

The AI Mind Palace is an interactive, 3D visualization of a Large Language Model's internal architecture. It's designed to provide an intuitive and engaging explanation of the inner workings of a large language model, from input to "thought" (Vectorial Consensus) to grounded output.

Vectorial Consensus is a term we've coined to describe the internal process of an AI reaching a definitive output. It's the moment when the system achieves the highest possible mathematical agreement across its entire network, resolving the ambiguity of the Latent Space into a single, coherent choice. For an AI, "thinking" is not a stream of consciousness, but an iterative search for this consensus.

## Key Concepts

The AI Mind Palace visualizes several key concepts in large language models:

*   **Vectorial Consensus:** The core of the AI's "thought process," where it reaches a definitive output by finding the highest mathematical agreement across its network.
*   **Latent Space:** The "starfield of concepts" where the AI's knowledge is stored as a geometric and numerical structure.
*   **Multi-Head Attention:** A parallel voting system where different "heads" focus on different aspects of the input:
    *   **Head 1 (Syntax):** Votes on grammatical correctness.
    *   **Head 2 (Semantics):** Votes on conceptual meaning.
    *   **Head 3 (Context):** Votes on what was just discussed.
    *   **Head 4 (Factual Retrieval):** Votes on core knowledge.
*   **Probability Collapse:** The final resolution of V-Consensus, where the AI selects the single best token to form the output.

## The Visualization

The 3D visualization represents the different components of the AI's internal architecture:

*   **The Transformer Agent (V-Consensus Core):** The central processor that coordinates the Attention Heads.
*   **Context & Memory Bank:** The AI's pre-trained knowledge and conversation history.
*   **Alignment Filter:** Sanitizes input and checks output for policy compliance and safety.
*   **Tokenizer (Input):** Converts raw data into numerical vectors/tokens.
*   **External Tool Module:** Accesses real-time, grounded data (e.g., Google Search) and specialized APIs (e.g., Text-to-Speech).
*   **Latent Space Cluster (LSC):** Dynamically retrieved vectors that provide context for the current step.
*   **Probability Collapse Workbench:** The final resolution of V-Consensus, where the single best token is selected to form the output.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
*   **JavaScript**
*   **Three.js**
*   **Gemini API** (for text generation and Text-to-Speech)
